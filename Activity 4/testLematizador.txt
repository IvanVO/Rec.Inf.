The exist of liquid water on Mar  one of the more hot debat matter about our cold red neighbor  is look increas like New research publish Monday in the journal Natur Astronomi indic that there realli is a buri reservoir of super salti water near the south pole Scientist say such a lake would signific improv the likelihood that Mar just might harbor microscop life of it own Some scientist remain unconvinc that what been seen is liquid water but the latest studi add weight to a tentat 2018 find from radar map of the planet crust made by the Mar Express robot orbit That research suggest that an underground "lake" of liquid water had pool beneath frozen layer of sediment near the south pole  akin to the subglaci lake detect beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet on Earth Earth subglaci lake are teem with bacteri life and similar life might surviv in liquid reservoir on Mar scientist have specul "We are much more confid now said Elena Pettinelli a professor of geophys at Roma Tre Univers in Itali who led the latest research and the earlier studi "We did mani more observ and we process the data complet differ Pettinelli and her team process 134 observ of the region near the south pole with ground-penetr radar from the Mar Express orbit from 2012 to 2019 more than four time as mani as befor cover a period of time more than twice as long They then appli a new techniqu to the observ data that has been use to find lake beneath the Antarctic ice sheet as well as an older techniqu use in the 2018 studi Both method indic that there is a "patchwork" of buri reservoir of liquid in the region Pettinelli said  a larg reservoir about 15 mile across surround by sever smaller patch up to 6 mile across The research cant tell how deep the reservoir go but they begin about a mile below the surfac she said And while the radar doesnt show what theyr made of they are probabl "hypersaline" solut  water satur with perchlor salt of calcium magnesium sodium and potassium  that keep them liquid at minus 90 degre Fahrenheit and below Pettinelli said The new studi of a potenti underground nich for life on Mar come just a few week after scientist report find potenti sign of life in the cloud of Venus If there realli are buri bodi of liquid water they might be a prime spot where microbi alien life could surviv on Mar perhap a remnant of the life that might have exist there billion of year ago if Mar had sea of water on it surfac Liquid water is a key ingredi for life as we know it although exot chemistri for life base on hydrocarbon or carbon dioxid have also been propos Mar is now thought to be bone dri but moistur in it atmospher freez dure Martian winter as water ice abov the perman carbon dioxid ice cap at the north and south pole If the discoveri is verifi it would be the first time liquid water has been found on Mar and it would have a profound impact on the search for extraterrestri life Steve Clifford of the Planetari Scienc Institut a nonprofit base in Tucson Arizona said he agre that an underground bodi of water is the most plausibl explan for the radar observ by Mar Express but he argu that it might not be as cold or as salti as the research suggest Clifford who work on the Mar Express mission but wasnt involv in the new studi said he think the underground liquid could be creat by heat from the planet hot interior melt the ici sediment in the same way that geotherm heat melt the base of the Antarctic ice sheet in some region That would mean that the underground reservoir on Mar neednt be extrem salti to stay liquid he said Not everyon is convinc by the new studi howev Planetari scientist Jack Holt of the Univers of Arizona Lunar and Planetari Laboratori in Tucson said in an email that Mar was probabl much too cold for even hypersalin water to exist as a liquid and that if it did then liquid water would also exist in region that look the same in the radar map "If we appli the same interpret then there should be spring flow out along the edg of the polar cap he said "And that is not the case Holt work with radar on the Mar Reconnaiss Orbiter which has seen no sign of liquid water The Mar Express research suggest that it is use the wrong radar wavelength to see them Holt also said ani descript of buri "lakes" of water is mislead "At best patchi wet sediment he said "But even that is a stretch
